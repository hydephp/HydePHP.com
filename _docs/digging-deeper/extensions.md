# Extensions and Integrations

## First party extensions

### Realtime Compiler

The Hyde Realtime Compiler is now included with Hyde
installations and is what powers the `php hyde serve` command.

- **GitHub**: [hydephp/realtime-compiler](https://github.com/hydephp/realtime-compiler)
- **Packagist**: [hydephp/realtime-compiler](https://packagist.org/packages/hyde/realtime-compiler)
- **YouTube video**: [Introducing the Hyde Realtime Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZM4fQMKi64)


## Integrations with third-party tools

### Torchlight

#### About Torchlight
Torchlight is an amazing API for syntax highlighting and is what this site uses.
I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially for documentation sites and code-heavy blogs!

#### Getting started
To get started you need an API token which you can get through the [torchlight.dev website](https://torchlight.dev/).
It is entirely [free for personal and open source projects](https://torchlight.dev/#pricing).

When you have an API token, set it in the `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
Once a token is set, Hyde will automatically enable the CommonMark extension.

```env
TORCHLIGHT_TOKEN=torch_<your-api-token>
```

#### Attribution and configuration

Note that you need to provide an attribution link, thankfully Hyde injects a customizable link automatically to all pages
that use Torchlight. You can of course disable this in the `config/torchlight.php` file.
```php
'attribution' => [
	'enabled' => true,
	'markdown' => 'Syntax highlighting by <a href="https://torchlight.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow">Torchlight.dev</a>',
],
```
