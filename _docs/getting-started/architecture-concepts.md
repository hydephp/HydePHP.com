# Key HydePHP Concepts

## Introduction to Hyde

HydePHP contains a few "magic" features so that you can focus on your content. It's encouraged that you read this page to get a high-level overview of what's going on behind the scenes.


## The HydeCLI

When you are not writing Markdown and Blade, most of your interactions with Hyde will be through the
Hyde Command Line Interface (CLI). 
Since the CLI is based on the Laravel Artisan Console, so you may actually already be familiar with it.

You should take a look at [the Console Commands page](console-commands)
to learn more and see the available commands and their usage.

```bash
php hyde <command> [--help]
```

## Directory structure

To take full advantage of the framework, it may first be good to familiarize ourselves with the directory structure.

```
// torchlight! {"lineNumbers": false}
â”œâ”€â”€ _docs  // For documentation pages              
â”œâ”€â”€ _posts // For blog posts
â”œâ”€â”€ _pages // For static Markdown and Blade pages
â”œâ”€â”€ _media // Store static assets to be copied to the build directory
â”œâ”€â”€ _site  // The build directory where your compiled site will be stored
â”œâ”€â”€ config // Configuration files for Hyde and integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/assets // Location for Laravel Mix source files (optional)
â””â”€â”€ resources/views/components // Location for Blade components (optional)
```

> Note that the `_site` directory is emptied every time you run the `hyde build` command.
> It's intended that you keep the directory out of your VCS, for example by adding it to your .gitignore file.


## File Autodiscovery

Content files, meaning source Markdown and Blade files, are automatically
discovered by Hyde and compiled to HTML when building the site.
This means that you don't need to worry about routing and controllers!

The directory a source file is in will determine the Blade template that is used to render it.

Here is an overview of the content source directories, the output directory of the compiled files,
and the file extensions supported by each. Files starting with an `_underscore` are ignored.

| Page/File Type | Source Directory | Output Directory | File Extensions     |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Static Pages   | `_pages/`        | `_site/`         | `.md`, `.blade.php` |
| Blog Posts     | `_posts/`        | `_site/posts/`   | `.md`               |
| Documentation  | `_docs/`         | `_site/docs/`    | `.md`               |
| Media Assets   | `_media/`        | `_site/media/`   | See full list below |

Default media file types supported: `.png`, `.svg`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.ico`, `.css`, `.js`. Can be changed using the `hyde.media_extensions` config setting.

## Convention over Configuration

Hyde favours the "Convention over Configuration" paradigm and thus comes preconfigured with sensible defaults.
However, Hyde also strives to be modular and endlessly customizable hackable if you need it. 
Take a look at the [customization and configuration guide](customization) to see the endless options available!

## Front Matter

### About

Front matter is heavily used in HydePHP to store metadata about about pages. Hyde uses the front matter data to generate rich and dynamic content. For example, a blog post category, author website, or featured image.

Using front matter is optional, as Hyde will dynamically generate data based on the content itself. (Though any matter you provide will take precedence over the automatically generated data.)

### Markdown

All Markdown content files support Front Matter. Blog posts for example make heavy use of it.

The specific usage and schemas used for pages are documented in their respective documentation, however, here is a primer on the fundamentals.

- Front matter is stored in a block of YAML that starts and ends with a `---` line.
- The front matter should be the very first thing in the Markdown file.
- Each key-pair value should be on its own line.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "My New Post"
author:
  name: "John Doe"
  website: https://mrhyde.example.com
---

## Markdown comes here

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, etc.
```

### Blade

>warning ðŸ§ª This feature is experimental, and currently does not support multidimensional arrays or multi-line directives as the BladeMatter is statically parsed.

Hyde v0.58.0-beta brings experimental support for creating front-matter in Blade templates, called BladeMatter. The actual syntax is does not use YAML; but instead PHP. However, the parsed end result is the same.

To create BladeMatter, you simply use the default Laravel Blade `@php` directive to declare a variable anywhere in the template.

**Example:**
```blade
@php($title = 'BladeMatter Demo')
```

It will then be available through the global `$page` variable, `$page->matter('title')`.


## Automatic Routing

>info This covers an intermediate topic which is not required for basic usage, but is useful if you want to use the framework to design custom Blade templates.

### High-level overview

If you've ever worked in a MVC framework, you are probably familiar with the concept of routing. And you are probably also familiar with how boring and tedious it can be. Hyde takes the pain out of routing through the Hyde Autodiscovery process.

Internally, when booting the Hyde application, Hyde will automatically discover all of the content files in the source directory and create a routing index for them. This index works as a two-way link between source files and compiled files.

Don't worry if this sounds complex, as the key takeaway is that the index is created and maintained automatically. There is currently no way to manually add or remove files from the index. Making it function more like a source map than a proper router. Nevertheless, the routing system provides several helpers that you can optionally use in your Blade views to automatically resolve relative links and other useful features.

### Accessing routes

Each route in your site is represented by a Route object. It's very easy to get a Route object instance from the Router's index. There are a few ways to do this, but most commonly you'll use the Route facade's `get()` method where you provide a route key, and it will return the Route object. The route key is generally `<output-directory/slug>`. Here are some examples:

```php
// Source file: _pages/index.md/index.blade.php
// Compiled file: _site/index.html
Route::get('index') 

// Source file: _posts/my-post.md
// Compiled file: _site/posts/my-post.html
Route::get('posts.my-post')

// Source file: _docs/readme.md
// Compiled file: _site/docs/readme.html
Route::get('docs.readme')
```

### Using the `x-link` component

When designing Blade layouts it can be useful to use the `x-link` component to automatically resolve relative links.

You can of course, use it just like a normal anchor tag like so:
```blade
<x-link href="index.html">Home</x-link>
```

But where it really shines is when you supply a route. This will then resolve the proper relative link, and format it to use pretty URLs if your site is configured to use them.

```blade
<x-link :href="Route::get('index')">Home</x-link>
```

You can of course, also supply extra attributes like classes:
```blade
<x-link :href="Route::get('index')" class="btn btn-primary">Home</x-link>
```

## Nested directories

### Introduction

Starting with Hyde v0.52.x-beta, there is limited support for nested directories, please be mindful that the behaviour of this may change until the next few versions. Please report any issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/issues).

#### First of, what do we mean by "nested directories"?

Simply put, a nested directory in Hyde is a source directory that contains a subdirectory. For example, if you have a directory _inside_ the `_pages` directory, that's a nested directory.

### Behaviour of nested pages

#### Automatically routed pages

As it is now, when you put a source file within a subdirectory of one of the following, it will be compiled into the corresponding output directory. 

The following page types use this behaviour:
- Blade pages (`_pages/`)
- Markdown pages (`_pages/`)
- Markdown blog posts (`_posts/`)

For example, a source file stored as `_pages/about/contact.md` will be compiled into `_site/about/contact.html`, and a blog post stored as `_posts/2022/my-post.md` will be compiled into `_site/posts/2022/my-post.html`.

#### Documentation pages

Documentation pages behave a bit differently. Here, all documentation source files will still be compiled to the `_site/docs/` directory, but the subdirectory name will be used to assign a sidebar group/category to the page.

So for example, a source file stored as `_docs/getting-started/installation.md` will be compiled into `_site/docs/installation`, and placed in the sidebar group `Getting Started`.

You can learn more about this in the [documentation pages documentation](documentation-pages#using-sub-directories).
