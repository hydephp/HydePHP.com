1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
All right, static site generators, everybody's talking about them.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
Seems like a new one pops up every day.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,560
Right. And this time we're doing a deep dive on HydePHP.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,240
At least that's what their docs are calling it.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,120
Catchy name.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,920
It really is. And they're making some bold claims.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,640
Elegance and power. All in one package.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Yeah, that focused on writing content, not markup line, caught my eye.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,520
Right. Because who wants to mess around with HTML tags all day?

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,160
Not me.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
Speak for yourself. I kind of like them.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,360
Yeah, but I see their point.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,760
They mentioned using Markdown, which is great for, well,

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,800
you know, just writing and Laravel, which is a PHP framework, right?

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
Kind of seems like overkill for a static site.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
Well, they're actually using Laravel zero.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
It's a stripped down version of Laravel built for speed.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,520
So they get the structure of a framework without all the plot.

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
Ah, so it's like they optimized it specifically for static sites?

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Exactly. They're playing to the strength of static sites, which is smart.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
And speaking of strengths, they really hype up the whole blazing fast angle.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,080
But is speed really that big of a deal?

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,000
Absolutely. First off, user experience, slow site,

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,360
say goodbye to visitors.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
Ouch. Yeah, nobody's got time for that spinny wheel of doom.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,120
Exactly. But it's also about the developer experience.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,880
If building and rebuilding the site is super fast, like they claim,

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,440
it makes the developer's life way easier.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,800
Quicker iterations, faster theme back loops, you know the drill.

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,680
Makes sense. It's like the faster you can see your changes,

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
the faster you can get stuff done.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
They also talk about being simple to get started, but powerful when you need it.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,120
Right. Like that classic balancing act.

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,080
Exactly. But who are they targeting with that message?

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,560
Who's the ideal HydePHP user?

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
Well, they definitely assume some command line comfort.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
You got to be okay, get in your hands a little dirty with code.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,200
So not exactly aimed at your average WordPress blogger, though?

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Probably not.

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,240
But they do emphasize no endless configuration,

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,120
which suggests a streamlined experience.

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,200
Might appeal to folks familiar with Jekyll or other minimal setups.

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,160
So previous static set experiences a plus. Got it.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,040
And they even include Tailwind CSS by default.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,760
Smart move. Tailwind's super popular for a reason.

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,400
For those who haven't used it, what's the big deal with Tailwind?

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,960
It's a utility for CSS framework.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,720
Basically pre-built styles, you can apply directly to your HTML,

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,320
make styling super fast.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,520
Ah, so it's like building blocks for your website's design.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
Exactly. And by including it by default,

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,040
they're not going out a setup step right off the bat.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Plus, Tailwind's known for producing clean,

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
professional looking sites.

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,760
So it aligns with that elegant thing they're going for.

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, you've convinced me, I'm ready to give it a shot.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
But real talk, how is time when we're talking to get this thing up and run it?

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,720
Not bad at all, actually.

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
You need PHP 8.1 or higher, pretty standard stuff.

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Check.

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,240
And Composer, it's a package manager for PHP.

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Helps you wrangle all the dependencies.

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,400
Right, kind of like, what's it called?

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
NPM for JavaScript?

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Yeah, kind of like that.

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Yeah.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,320
And installations of Breeze just follow the instructions on the HydePHP website.

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,840
No crazy workarounds or anything?

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
Nope, they keep it nice and straight forward.

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
Use it to my ears.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Okay, so I've got it installed.

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm ready to roll what's the workflow actually like.

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,160
Almost too easy.

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,360
You basically just drop your Markdown files into a specific folder

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,000
or use hyde commands to generate some starter templates.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then you run hyde build and bam,

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,760
you've got a directory full of static HTML ready to deploy wherever you want.

78
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,160
Hold on, did you just say drop Markdown files and go?

79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,200
That's it?

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,760
Pretty much.

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
It's surprisingly streamlined.

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,960
I got to ask what's the catch.

83
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,120
Well, the big question is customization.

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
They talk a big game about ease of use,

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,320
but how far does that go?

86
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,520
Can you really get under the hood and tweak things?

87
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,040
Or do you hit a point where you need to break out the full Laravel toolkit?

88
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Yeah, that's something to consider.

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,680
Yeah.

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,400
Like is it truly flexible or more of a

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
works great if you stay within the lines kind of thing?

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
Exactly.

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
That's something you'd want to investigate further.

94
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,160
Especially if you're planning on building something really custom.

95
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,440
But for simpler sites or getting up and running quickly,

96
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,160
HydePHP looks pretty darn slick.

97
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,200
It really does.

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
So to sum it all up, HydePHP.

99
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
It's like that shiny new sports car in the showroom.

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,520
Potentially powerful promises a smooth ride,

101
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,400
but maybe take it for a test drive before you sign on the dotted line.

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,280
That being said, that test drive might just inspire your next awesome website.

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,400
This has been the Deep Dive.
