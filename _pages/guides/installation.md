# How to download and install HydePHP

## Introduction

On this page you will find a quickstart guide on how to install HydePHP. For more detailed information, please refer to the [HydePHP documentation](https://hydephp.com/docs/1.x/quickstart).

## System Requirements

You need to have the following software installed on your system:

- [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) or higher is required to run the HydePHP software on your system.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), the PHP package manager, is required to install the HydePHP dependencies.

## Installation

HydePHP is installed on a per-project basis. This means that each project you create will have its own HydePHP files.

To create a new HydePHP project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project hyde/hyde
```

This will create a new directory called `hyde` in your current working directory. This directory contains all the files needed to run HydePHP.

## Next steps

Now that you have installed HydePHP, you can start building your website. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the [HydePHP documentation](https://hydephp.com/docs/1.x/quickstart).
