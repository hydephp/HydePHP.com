## Double Your Donation to HydePHP!

We're excited to share an opportunity to support HydePHP and make your contribution go even further!

Simon Hamp ([@simonhamp](https://x.com/simonhamp)) has launched a [generous matching donation campaign](https://x.com/simonhamp/status/1845840688438526159) for open-source projects. Here's how you can participate and help HydePHP:

1. Donate any amount to [HydePHP's OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/hydephp).
2. Send your donation receipt to Simon Hamp.
3. Simon will match your donation up to $10!

This is a fantastic chance to double your impact and support the ongoing development of HydePHP, the Laravel-based static site generator.

### Why Support HydePHP?

Your contributions help cover hosting costs, development tools, and enable us to create more resources for the community. Every donation, no matter the size, makes a difference.

### Act Now!

Simon's campaign aims to raise $2,000 for 100 open-source projects. Let's make sure HydePHP is one of them! Donate today and help us continue improving the HydePHP experience for everyone.

Thank you for your support and for being part of the HydePHP community!
