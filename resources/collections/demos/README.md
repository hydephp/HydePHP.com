# HydePHP Demo Websites

In this directory are YAML partial files that each will become an entry on the [HydePHP Live Demos](https://hydephp.com/demos) page.

## Adding a demo site

To add a demo site to the HydePHP Live Demos page, create a new YAML file in this directory with the following format:

```yaml
title: "Demo Site Title"
description: "A very brief description of the demo site."
author: "Author Name"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
image: "demo-image.png"
url: "https://example.com"
source: "https://github.com/username/repo" # Optional
```
