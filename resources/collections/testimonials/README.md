# HydePHP Testimonials

In this directory are front mattered Markdown partial files that each will become an entry on the [HydePHP Testimonials](https://hydephp.com#testimonials) homepage section.

## Adding a testimonial

To add a testimonial to the HydePHP Testimonials section, create a new Markdown file in this directory with the following format:

```markdown
---
name: "Author Name"
title: "Job Title" # Optional
company: "Company Name" # Optional
company_url: "https://company.com" # Optional
twitter_link: "https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890" # If the testimonial was shared on Twitter
twitter_username: "username" # If the testimonial was shared on Twitter, this is used to link to the author name
---

The testimonial content goes here. It should be a brief quote that is no more than a few sentences long.
```

### Editing policy

Testimonials may be edited for formatting, spelling, and brevity, but never content.

### License and permissions

We operate under the assumption that if a testimonial is shared publicly, it is okay for us to share it on the HydePHP website.

If you are the author of a testimonial and would like it removed, you can contact us and we will remove it promptly. 
You can also submit a [pull request](https://github.com/hydephp/hydephp.com/tree/master/resources/collections/testimonials) to remove it yourself.
