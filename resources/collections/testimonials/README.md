# HydePHP Testimonials

In this directory are front mattered Markdown partial files that each will become an entry on the [HydePHP Testimonials](https://hydephp.com#testimonials) homepage section.

## Adding a testimonial

To add a testimonial to the HydePHP Testimonials section, create a new Markdown file in this directory with the following format:

```markdown
---
name: "Author Name"
title: "Job Title" # Optional
company: "Company Name" # Optional
company_url: "https://company.com" # Optional
twitter_link: "https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890" # If the testimonial was shared on Twitter
twitter_username: "username" # If the testimonial was shared on Twitter, this is used to link to the author name
---

The testimonial content goes here. It should be a brief quote that is no more than a few sentences long.
```
